# @prototype/ui-shared

Shared theme, auth hook, and entrance animation for both Expo apps. Consumed as TS source
(`main: src/index.ts`). Depends on `@prototype/api-client` for auth calls.

- `theme.ts` is the design system's single source of truth — no ad-hoc colors in apps;
  reach for `ThemeContext` over prop-drilling styles.
- `useAuth` is the one auth state hook; both apps wrap their root with it.
