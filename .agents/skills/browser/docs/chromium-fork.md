# BetterChromium

BetterWright runs the pinned BetterChromium 153 fork while keeping its
public `run()`, `human.*`, `captcha.*`, snapshot, policy, proxy, and vault
APIs unchanged. On platforms with a checksum-pinned release asset,
`betterwright setup` / `betterwright update` download the fork into the
zero-config discovery root. It is the runtime backend on supported hosts —
the only bundled browser. Platforms without a published artifact, or operators
who want a different browser entirely, use the [provider
option](browser-providers.md) (a local binary, any CDP endpoint, or a cloud
provider).

## Install / update

Before upgrading an existing installation, finish active work and close any apps
using BetterWright. Run `betterwright close --all` to stop CLI browser sessions
before setup or update. Restart SDK applications afterward to load the new browser.

```bash
betterwright update          # download fork → ~/.betterwright/chromium/
betterwright update --force  # re-fetch + re-verify even if already present
betterwright setup           # install the managed browser for this host
```

Artifacts come from a revisioned GitHub Release tag such as
`betterchromium-<version>-rN` (see `CHROMIUM_FORK_RELEASE_TAG` /
`CHROMIUM_FORK_ASSETS` in `src/chromium-fork.ts`). Revisioning keeps older
published BetterWright packages bound to their original immutable assets.
Each zip is SHA-256 pinned in the manifest before extract. The installer stages
and validates the replacement before swapping the platform directory, then
records the version, release tag, asset name, and verified checksum in
`.betterwright-install.json` beside the platform's bundle or binary. `setup` and
`update` replace older or unverified installations without `--force`; a download
or extraction failure preserves the previous files. If the process stops during
the directory swap, the next setup restores the prior installation before
attempting any download, including when offline.

Default discovery requires a receipt matching the package's pinned release.
After updating BetterWright, run `betterwright setup` before launching: an older
binary or a missing/corrupt receipt produces setup guidance instead of running
an unverified managed browser. Copy the entire platform directory, including
the receipt, when deploying an installation.

On Windows, BetterChromium also requires Chromium's version-named private
assembly manifest beside `betterchromium.exe`. BetterWright validates that
manifest and `chrome_elf.dll` before launch. Managed installs missing the
manifest and carrying a matching installation receipt are repaired by
`setup`, `update`, `doctor`, or the next managed-browser resolution; explicitly
configured artifact paths are never modified and receive an actionable error.
If a managed tree is also missing `chrome_elf.dll`, ordinary `setup` treats it
as incomplete and downloads a clean pinned archive without requiring `--force`.

## Runtime Selection

Use an exact executable path:

```bash
export BETTERWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_PATH=/absolute/path/to/betterchromium
betterwright run -c 'return await page.title()'
```

Or point at the packaged artifact root:

```bash
export BETTERWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_ROOT=/absolute/path/to/artifacts
betterwright run -c 'return await page.title()'
```

The artifact-root layout is fixed:

```text
artifacts/
  mac-arm64/BetterChromium.app/Contents/MacOS/BetterChromium
  linux-x64/betterchromium
  win-x64/betterchromium.exe
```

The public manifest contains verified macOS arm64, Linux x64, and Windows x64
archives. A platform archive is accepted only when its complete bytes match the
SHA-256 value pinned in `src/chromium-fork.ts`.

`BETTERWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_PATH` takes precedence over
`BETTERWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_ROOT`. Configured paths must be absolute and must exist;
BetterWright fails closed instead of silently launching another browser.
Explicit artifact paths are operator-managed and do not require the managed
installer's receipt; the operator must keep that browser patched.

Managed browser updates apply only to BetterChromium installed by BetterWright.
An Electron attachment uses the Chromium embedded in the host's Electron
version, and a remote CDP connection uses the provider's browser. Upgrade that
host or provider separately; updating BetterWright does not patch its browser.

Set the backend policy independently of artifact location:

```bash
export BETTERWRIGHT_BACKEND=auto            # default
export BETTERWRIGHT_BACKEND=chromium-fork   # require the native fork
```

An invalid value is an error. `chromium-fork` remains fail-closed when its
artifact is absent. (The old `cloak` value and the `=off` path toggle selected
a bundled compatibility browser that no longer exists; both are now rejected
with the migration guidance.)

## Zero-Config Discovery and Platform Routing

With neither variable set, BetterWright checks the default root
`~/.betterwright/chromium/` for the current platform's artifact and matching
installation receipt. A verified installation runs with no configuration. If the platform is supported but its
artifact is missing, launch fails with setup guidance; if the platform has no
published artifact at all, the error names the provider option.

```text
~/.betterwright/chromium/
  mac-arm64/BetterChromium.app/Contents/MacOS/BetterChromium
  linux-x64/betterchromium
  win-x64/betterchromium.exe
```

## Containers and OS sandboxes

On supported platforms BetterChromium remains fail-closed: a missing native
artifact does not silently change browser engines. A container or
`bwrap --clearenv` lane must bind the installed artifact into the sandbox and
set an absolute path inside that namespace, for example:

```bash
betterwright setup
# Bind ~/.betterwright/chromium at /opt/betterwright/chromium in the sandbox,
# then set this inside the cleared environment:
export BETTERWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_ROOT=/opt/betterwright/chromium
```

The profile, runtime, and artifacts under `BETTERWRIGHT_HOME` need their normal
writable mount. On Linux, an accessible `/dev/dri` render device gives the
fork hardware GL; without one the fork launches with the SwiftShader software
WebGL fallback, and the missing-device warning appears in run results and
`betterwright doctor`. Every network connection still passes through the
worker's local SOCKS guard.

On Windows, the managed browser selects ANGLE's Direct3D 11 backend. Forcing
desktop OpenGL can leave accelerated 2D canvas readback blank and WebGPU
unavailable even when WebGL draws successfully.

**Profiles are not interchangeable across Chromium majors.** A profile upgraded
by a newer Chromium cannot be opened by an older one. Managed launch refuses
that downgrade rather than creating a compatibility profile automatically.
Preserve the old profile and select a fresh named `--profile` or a separate
`BETTERWRIGHT_HOME`, or move aside only the profile directory named in the error
and sign in again. Browser sign-ins are not copied; vault credentials remain
outside the browser profile and survive moving it.

**Match timezone/locale to egress** (or enable `geoip` with `upstreamProxy`).
Nothing in the fork hard-codes Singapore or any other region — pin whatever
geography the exit IP actually has.

## Control Plane

The fork is launched through stock `playwright-core` over normal CDP. Custom
behavior lives in Chromium/V8 (deferred inspector console delivery). No
page-world stealth shim is installed. Patchright/`stealthRuntimeFix` applies
to the fork; it cannot be combined with a provider browser.

## Runtime Efficiency

The managed launch profile applies a soft renderer-process ceiling of two.
That removes Chromium 151's unused spare renderer for the normal one-page
workload while retaining Chromium's ability to exceed the ceiling whenever
site isolation requires another process.

Screenshots are encoded with Playwright's CSS-pixel scale. This does not change
the page viewport, device pixel ratio, screen metrics, canvas/WebGL rendering,
or WebGPU identity. It only avoids storing four physical pixels for every CSS
pixel in proof artifacts.

## Identity

| Option | Native behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `locale` | `--lang` and `--fingerprint-locale` |
| `timezone` | `--bw-timezone` (alias `--fingerprint-timezone`) |
| `platform` | `--fingerprint-platform`; defaults to the **host platform** |
| `headless` | Real native headless |
| `headedInvisible` | Headed window parked off-screen |
| `upstreamProxy` / `geoip` | Policy-checked egress; locale/tz from egress when enabled |

## No platform masking

The fork presents the operating system it actually runs on. The earlier
Linux→macOS masquerade (captured consumer-Mac identity, macOS-metric fonts,
window geometry, UA/UA-CH overrides) was removed: every layer of a masked
identity is a separate tell the moment one value disagrees with the host, and
the fork's source patches keep a headless Linux browser coherent *as* a Linux
desktop browser instead. The binary patch set in
[chromium-fork-patches.md](chromium-fork-patches.md) remains — UA/UA-CH at the
source, `navigator.platform`, WebGL renderer/vendor, deterministic
per-profile canvas/audio farbling, and screen and window geometry — now all
reporting the real platform. The explicit `platform` option pins a specific
identity when a workflow genuinely needs one.

Launch-identity coherence still applies; see
[launch-identity.md](launch-identity.md).
