# Native CAPTCHA helpers

![A puzzle piece completing a "verify you are human" challenge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BetterWright/betterwright/main/docs/assets/captcha.png)

BetterWright solves simple CAPTCHAs **inside the existing browser session**. It
does not send sitekeys, tokens, screenshots, or API keys to a third-party
solving service, and it does not load a heavy local ML runtime. The automatic
solver is open-source, self-hosted by definition (it runs in your managed
browser), and keeps a small memory footprint: ordinary DOM inspection plus the
same human-shaped mouse motion used elsewhere.

> Use these helpers only for a legitimate flow you are authorized to complete.
> Never rotate identities or repeat a failed action. A rejected repeat of the
> same stage requires an immediate alternate source or human handoff; otherwise,
> work through at most three distinct challenge types before taking that
> handoff. Replacement photo grids after Verify are the same image-grid stage.

When BetterWright detects a visible challenge, the result contains a structured
`challenges` entry (including `stage`, `autoSolvable`, and `needsVision`) and,
when capture succeeds, an attached `captcha` image. This also happens when the
browser snippet itself failed. Keep the same page and profile, inspect that
state, and continue on the next turn.

## Automatic solver (preferred)

`captcha.solve(options?)` is the 2Captcha-shaped entry point that stays fully
local:

```js
return await captcha.solve({ timeoutMs: 45_000, maxStages: 3 });
```

`timeoutMs` is in **milliseconds** (clamped to 3000–180000) — unlike the host
`run()` timeout, which is in seconds. `timeout` is accepted as an alias with
the same millisecond unit; prefer `timeoutMs` so the unit stays visible.

`maxStages` defaults to `3` and is clamped to `1`–`3`: handoff is required after
at most three distinct stages, so a caller cannot ask the solver to keep working
a challenge that has already rejected it three times.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `status` | `ready` (cleared), `processing` (needs vision / another stage), or `error` |
| `request` / `requestId` | Local solve id (2Captcha-style request handle) |
| `provider` | `recaptcha`, `hcaptcha`, `turnstile`, `cloudflare`, `bing`, `google`, `generic`, … |
| `stage` | `checkbox`, `turnstile`, `managed_challenge`, `image_grid`, `slider`, `text`, … |
| `cleared` | `true` when the challenge is gone or a response token is present |
| `token` | Response token when a widget wrote one into the page |
| `tiles` | Image-grid tile bounds and indexes for host vision (when `status === "processing"`) |
| `grid` | `{ rows, cols }` when a numbered image grid was captured |
| `artifact` | Attached captcha PNG (`MEDIA:…`) for vision stages — a tight crop with overlay numbers |
| `attempts` | Per-stage action log |
| `local` / `externalApi` | Always `true` / `false` — no remote solver |

### What auto-solves without vision

| Stage | Strategy |
| --- | --- |
| Checkbox (reCAPTCHA / hCaptcha / generic) | Human-shaped click on the widget |
| Cloudflare Turnstile | Click the widget, wait for `cf-turnstile-response` |
| Managed Cloudflare check | Click verify if present, then wait for clearance |
| Slider / puzzle handle | Human-shaped drag across the track |
| Motion / canvas (“shape that grows”) | Sample animation frames, click the blob that grew, then **Next** |
| Drag-to-fit | Drag the filled piece onto the hollow slot |

### What still needs the host model

| Stage | What `solve()` returns |
| --- | --- |
| Image grid (“select all images with …”) | `status: "processing"`, numbered crop + `tiles[]` + `grid`. Open the image, then `captcha.solve({ tiles: [indexes] })` |
| Text CAPTCHA | `status: "processing"`, tight crop + instruction |
| Motion (only if frame-diff is ambiguous) | Two live crops; click the growing shape, then `captcha.solve()` again |

Example vision handoff for an image grid:

```js
const first = await captcha.solve();
if (first.status === "ready") return first;
if (first.status === "processing" && first.tiles?.length) {
  // Host vision picks matching tile indexes from the numbered crop.
  return captcha.solve({ tiles: [0, 3, 5] });
}
return first;
```

Tile indexes only mean something relative to the crop they came from. If the
page navigates or the challenge swaps in a new grid between the capture and the
picks, the stored coordinates are discarded rather than replayed: `solve()`
returns `processing` again with a fresh numbered crop (the attempt log records
`recapture_tiles`), and `captcha.clickTiles` throws and asks for a new
`captcha.solve()`. That keeps clicks off the wrong tiles and stops a stale
selection from being submitted to Verify.

### Detection only

```js
return await captcha.detect();
// { present, challenge, classification, widgets, tokens, cleared, url }
```

## Manual helpers

Every `run()` snippet has a frozen `captcha` global:

| Helper | Purpose | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `captcha.solve(options?)` | Local automatic multi-stage solver. Pass `{ tiles: [indexes] }` after reading the numbered crop. | Solve envelope (`ready` / `processing` / `error`) |
| `captcha.detect()` | Structured widget + stage report | Detection object |
| `captcha.inspect(bounds?)` | Capture the whole page or a challenge region for the agent's vision | `captcha` image artifact |
| `captcha.click(bounds)` | Click a checkbox-style widget | Fresh accessibility snapshot |
| `captcha.clickTiles(indexes)` | Click stored numbered tiles and the verify control | Fresh accessibility snapshot |
| `captcha.drag(from, to, {steps: 20})` | Smoothly drag a slider or puzzle handle | Fresh accessibility snapshot |
| `captcha.readText(bounds?)` | Capture only a text challenge for the agent's existing vision | `captcha` image artifact |

`bounds` uses CSS pixels: `{x, y, width, height}`. `from` and `to` use
`{x, y}`. The click helper targets the left side of the supplied widget bounds,
where checkbox challenges normally place their control.

## Checkbox challenge

```js
// Preferred: let the local solver find and click the widget.
return captcha.solve();

// Manual fallback:
const frame = page.locator('iframe[title*="challenge" i], iframe[src*="captcha" i]').first();
const bounds = await frame.boundingBox();
if (!bounds) throw new Error('CAPTCHA widget is not visible');
return captcha.click(bounds);
```

The returned snapshot (manual path) is captured after the click. The result
envelope also contains BetterWright's current `challenges` report. If the
checkbox opens an image grid, that is a new stage; call `captcha.solve()` again
or inspect rather than clicking the checkbox again.

## Slider or puzzle drag

```js
return captcha.solve(); // auto-drags when a slider stage is classified

// Manual fallback:
const handle = page.locator('[role="slider"], .slider-handle').first();
const bounds = await handle.boundingBox();
if (!bounds) throw new Error('Slider handle is not visible');
const from = {x: bounds.x + bounds.width / 2, y: bounds.y + bounds.height / 2};
return captcha.drag(from, {x: from.x + 280, y: from.y}, {steps: 24});
```

## Text challenge

```js
const solved = await captcha.solve();
if (solved.status === "processing") {
  // Host vision reads solved.artifact, then:
  // await page.locator('input[name*="captcha" i]').fill(text);
  // await page.locator('button[type="submit"]').click();
  // return captcha.solve();
}
return solved;
```

## Image-grid challenge (reCAPTCHA / hCaptcha)

A checkbox click frequently escalates to an image grid — "select all images with
bicycles". `captcha.solve()` crops the widget, overlays a number on each tile,
and returns that image with `tiles[]` and `grid`. Open the attached crop, pick
the matching indexes, and finish in one call:

```js
const first = await captcha.solve();
if (first.status === "ready") return first;
if (first.status === "processing" && first.tiles?.length) {
  return captcha.solve({ tiles: [0, 3, 5] }); // indexes your vision picked
}
return first;
```

Inspect the fresh `challenges` report after Verify. A replacement set of photos
with the same prompt is still the image-grid stage — pick the new numbered
crop and call `captcha.solve({ tiles })` again. A rejected Verify (try-again
on the same grid) is not: stop native attempts and use an alternate first-party
source or request human help. Otherwise continue through no more than three
distinct challenge types (checkbox, image grid, slider, …) before that handoff.
When the challenge clears, verify the current application state before resuming.
Replay the original action only if it is idempotent or the state proves it did
not already complete; never duplicate a submission, purchase, or message.

## When detection runs

Every `run()` result is scanned for a challenge, but the scan is staged. Stage 1
always reads the main frame — its title, its body text, its filled provider
response fields, and the geometry and (same-origin) text of its child frames.
Stage 2 reads every frame individually, which costs a round trip per frame and
so runs only when something already points at a challenge:

- a provider frame or main-document URL (reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha, Turnstile, the
  Cloudflare challenge platform, Google `/sorry`, Bing challenge paths);
- main-frame or same-origin-frame text that the detector matches;
- a 403, 429 or 503 document response — main frame **or** subframe — within the
  last 10 seconds;
- a challenge still unresolved at the end of the previous `run()`;
- any frame stage 1 could not read (cross-origin) whose URL is challenge-shaped
  — the commercial vendors that do not name a provider in their frame URL
  (DataDome, Arkose/FunCaptcha, AWS WAF, PerimeterX, GeeTest) as well as
  self-hosted `…/captcha/…`, `…/challenge…`, `…/verify…` endpoints;
- up to three unreadable cross-origin frames regardless of what their URLs say.

`captcha.solve()` and `captcha.detect()` never stage: they always read every
frame.

**Accepted limitation.** A page carrying **more than three** cross-origin frames
whose URLs are entirely unremarkable, where one of them is a challenge
identifiable only by its text, is not detected automatically. Text is the only
evidence in that case and reading it is exactly the per-frame cost the staging
exists to avoid. Call `captcha.detect()` explicitly if you are working a page
you expect to challenge you from an opaque embedded frame.

## Efficiency

The solver adds no worker processes, ONNX/TensorFlow runtimes, or OCR binaries.
Peak cost is a few short Playwright frame queries, optional PNG screenshots
already budgeted by BetterWright's artifact quota, and ordinary mouse events.
Host vision (when needed for image grids) reuses the model you already run the
agent with — it is not a second paid captcha API.

## Limits

These helpers reproduce normal mouse interaction, wait for provider response
fields (`g-recaptcha-response`, `h-captcha-response`, `cf-turnstile-response`),
and provide a token-efficient vision crop. They do not manufacture reCAPTCHA,
hCaptcha, or Turnstile tokens offline, send challenges to a third-party solver,
or guarantee that a provider will accept the managed browser. An invisible or
scored challenge may have no native interaction to perform; preserve the page
and request human help instead of looping or changing identity.

Public unit and browser fixtures cover the local pipeline end-to-end.

### Live contract tests are not verified solves

The optional `BETTERWRIGHT_LIVE_CAPTCHA=1` tests in
`tests/node/captcha-e2e.test.ts` exercise Google reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha, and
Cloudflare Turnstile demos. A passing test validates the helper contract,
including its permitted `ready`, `processing`, and `error` statuses and the
local/no-external-API assertions made by that test. It does **not** establish
that the CAPTCHA was solved: a processing result with no token can pass, as
can a helper-reported error. Bot-scoring may still block headless or datacenter
IPs regardless of correct clicks.

Each demo logs an explicit harness-only `outcome`:

| Outcome | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| `error` | The helper returned `error`; this takes precedence even if a response field contains a token. |
| `token_received` | A nonempty provider response field was observed after the attempt, without a helper error. This is token receipt, not server acceptance. |
| `needs_vision` | No token was observed and the helper returned `processing` for an image-grid or text stage. Host vision is still needed; the live test does not perform that step. |
| `unresolved` | No token was observed and the helper returned another `processing` stage. The bounded demo attempt did not establish completion; this alone does not establish that human handoff is required. |
| `unverified` | No token was observed and none of the above applies, including `ready` when a widget disappeared or no challenge was detected. |

The logs report only response lengths (`tokenLen`), including hCaptcha's;
they do not print token values. Every demo reports
`serverAcceptance: "unverified"` because these tests do not submit the demo
form and verify the server's response. A verified solve requires explicit
server acceptance or a confirmed successful protected action, not merely a
token, a `ready` status, or a green contract test. This reporting lives only
in the test harness; it adds no runtime envelope fields or model-token cost.
