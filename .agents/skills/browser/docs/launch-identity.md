# Launch identity

Launch identity keeps BetterWright's managed browser coherent across the two
layers that sites score. It replaces the old "Cloaking V2" layer; the browser
is always the managed BetterChromium fork (see
[chromium-fork.md](chromium-fork.md)). For a browser that is not the managed
fork, see [browser-providers.md](browser-providers.md).

1. **Chromium layer** - the fork's source-level patches, a stable
   fingerprint seed, and native locale/timezone flags.
2. **IP layer** - an optional upstream egress proxy chained through the local
   policy guard, with locale/timezone resolved to match the egress geography.

The model API is unchanged: snippets, snapshots, `human.*`, `captcha.*`,
credentials, and proof captures work as before.

## The fork presents the host it runs on

The identity layer deliberately does **not** mask the operating system. A
Linux host is a Linux browser: `navigator.platform`, the UA, UA-CH client
hints, screen geometry, and GPU strings all report the real platform, kept
coherent by the fork's source patches. Masking a Linux process as a consumer
Mac made every mismatch (fonts, WebGL renderer, media codecs, worker
behavior) a separate tell; the fork's patches keep a headless Linux browser
coherent *as* a Linux desktop browser instead. The explicit `platform` option
remains for pinning a specific identity, but nothing defaults away from the
host.

The identity layer does not monkey-patch browser APIs in the page world. The
managed binary remains authoritative for canvas, WebGL, audio, fonts,
plugins, hardware, automation markers, and client hints.

| Surface | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Geometry | Native fork geometry; headed-invisible parks a real window off-screen |
| Locale | `--lang`, `--fingerprint-locale`, and Accept-Language |
| Timezone | `--bw-timezone`, so `Intl` and `Date` agree |
| Platform | `--fingerprint-platform=<host>` — the real host OS |
| GPU, plugins, hardware | Fork source-level fingerprint patches |
| JavaScript APIs | Left native; no replacement getters or functions |
| Service workers | Blocked in new contexts while default-on ad blocking is enabled; allowed when it is disabled. Existing remote contexts have [coverage limits](ad-blocking.md#filtering) |

In the recorded identity comparison, forcing page-world values made a synthetic
probe look perfect, but live reCAPTCHA checks stalled. Leaving the APIs native
restored server-verified `0.9` in both true-headless and headed modes. These
were demo observations, not an acceptance guarantee for future runs or sites.

## Launch modes

- **Headless** (CLI default): a real `--headless` fork process with a realistic
  desktop viewport. This is not an off-screen headed substitute.
- **Headed** (`--headed`): a normal visible browser window.
- **Headed-invisible** (`headedInvisible: true` / `--headed-invisible`): a
  headed window parked off-screen for workflows that explicitly need native
  window compositing.

The JavaScript SDK instead defaults to `headless: "auto"`: headed when a
display is available, headless otherwise. Pass `true` or `false` to pin it.
See [display detection](attach-mode.md#choosing-the-display-mode).

## Egress proxy

```js
const browser = new BetterWright({
  upstreamProxy: "socks5://user:pass@residential-egress:1080",
  geoip: true,
});
```

- Supports `http://` and `socks5://` upstreams with optional credentials.
- Every connection is still policy-checked and DNS-validated locally.
- The guard tunnels to the validated literal IP, preserving DNS-rebinding
  protection while the target observes the upstream IP.
- Every policy-approved destination goes through the upstream, including
  loopback and private addresses: `http://localhost` and `192.168.x.x` then
  name the *proxy host's* loopback and LAN, not this machine's. Pair a remote
  upstream with `allowLoopback: false` and `allowPrivateNetwork: false` (or
  restrict those ranges on the proxy) unless reaching the proxy's network is
  intended.
- WebRTC is forced onto the proxied path.
- `geoip: true` resolves locale/timezone through the upstream. Explicit
  `locale` and `timezone` values always win.

## Verification

Build the runtime and type-check the harness first with `bun run build:harness`.

```bash
bun research/stealth-report.ts
bun research/stealth-report.ts --live
bun research/stealth-report.ts --live --site recaptcha-v3-score
```

The local fixture checks roughly 30 browser surfaces against stock-Chrome
behavior. The table records earlier runs against server-verified score
endpoints; it is not a verification of the current release or a promise that
another session will receive the same scores:

| Check | True headless | Headed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local fixture | stock-Chrome parity | stock-Chrome parity |
| `antcpt.com/score_detector` | 0.9 | 0.9 |
| `democaptcha.com` | 0.9 | 0.9 |

`recaptcha-demo.appspot.com` was not an acceptance gate in those runs. Its widget
reported that the site exceeded its Enterprise free quota, so an unresolved
request there did not establish browser detection.

Interactive CAPTCHA issuance is a separate gate. In those recorded public-demo
runs, Turnstile remained at `processing` without a token in both modes, while
reCAPTCHA v2 escalated to an image grid that requires vision. The report prints
`tokenIssued` explicitly so those outcomes cannot be mistaken for a pass.
