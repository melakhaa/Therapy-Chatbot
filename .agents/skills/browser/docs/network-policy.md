# Network policy

![A hardened policy blocks private and metadata addresses while public traffic flows through](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BetterWright/betterwright/main/docs/assets/network-policy.png)

For locally launched browsers and guarded Electron attachments, every browser
request is authorized before it goes out — page navigations, subresources
(scripts, images, XHR/fetch), WebSocket upgrades, and
the raw TCP connections the worker's transport makes on the browser's behalf.
The worker sends each one to the client as a `guard` request; the client answers
it with a `NetworkPolicy`.

Ordinary remote CDP/provider browsers do not use the local transport guard.
Playwright routing still checks requests where the attached browser supports
it, but the transport-level metadata floor and DNS-rebinding protection do not
apply. See [browser providers](browser-providers.md#what-changes-with-a-remote-browser).

## The default posture

`NetworkPolicy()` with no arguments:

- **Blocks cloud instance-metadata endpoints** — the hostnames
  `metadata.google.internal` / `metadata.goog` and the link-local addresses
  (`169.254.169.254`, `169.254.170.2`, `100.100.100.200`, `fd00:ec2::…`). These
  can never be allowlisted or disabled; see below.
- **Blocks non-web schemes** — only `http`, `https`, `ws`, and `wss` are
  routable (`about:blank`, `data:`, and `blob:` are allowed).
- **Allows the public internet, private networks, and loopback** — RFC 1918
  ranges, `127.0.0.0/8`, `localhost`, IPv6 loopback/unique-local, link-local,
  carrier-grade NAT, and `*.internal`/`*.local`/`*.lan` hosts are reachable, so
  an agent can drive local dev servers, a home router, or an intranet host
  without extra configuration.

This keeps the one non-negotiable protection — the machine's own cloud identity
is never reachable — while letting an agent browse real sites and local
infrastructure out of the box. For an agent running somewhere its private
network is sensitive, harden it:

```js
const policy = new NetworkPolicy({ allowPrivateNetwork: false, allowLoopback: false });
```

That restores the strict posture: only the public internet (plus any
`allowHosts` you name) is reachable.

## Tuning the policy

```js
import { BetterWright, NetworkPolicy } from "betterwright";

const policy = new NetworkPolicy({
  allowPrivateNetwork: false,           // harden: block RFC 1918 / intranet
  allowLoopback: true,                  // but keep 127.0.0.1 and localhost
  allowHosts: ["staging.internal:8443"], // re-allow one internal host, one port
  blockHosts: ["ads.example.com"],      // deny even though it is public
});
new BetterWright({ policy });
```

| Option | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `allowLoopback` | Permit `127.0.0.1` / `localhost` (for local dev servers). Does **not** open the wider private network. Default `true`; `false` blocks loopback on its own. |
| `allowPrivateNetwork` | Permit RFC 1918, link-local, and `*.internal`/`*.local` hosts. Does **not** govern loopback. Default `true`; set `false` to block. |
| `allowHosts` | Allow these hosts in the built-in decision, unless metadata or `blockHosts` denies them. An entry matches a host exactly or as a parent domain (`example.com` also matches `sub.example.com`); add `:port` to pin a port. A custom hook can override ordinary decisions. |
| `blockHosts` | Block these hosts in the built-in decision, before allowlists. A custom hook may override this denial, but never the metadata floor. |
| `custom` | A hook, `custom(url, details)`, returning a decision or `null`, evaluated last. |

Hostnames are compared in their normalized form: lowercase, with one trailing
dot removed, so `https://example.com./` is subject to the same `blockHosts`,
metadata, and private-name rules as `https://example.com/`.

`allowHosts` adds exceptions to the normal policy; it is not an exclusive site
allowlist. Other public sites remain allowed. Restricting browsing to specific
destinations requires a trusted custom policy, including handling the
resolved-literal transport checks described below.

Evaluation order is: scheme check → metadata floor → `blockHosts` →
`allowHosts` → private-network rules → `custom`. A custom allow is checked
against the metadata floor again.

### The custom hook

The hook receives the URL and the request `details` (`method`, `resourceType`,
`isNavigation`, and — for a resolved literal — `resolvedFrom`). Return a decision
object to override, or `null` to keep the decision made so far.

```js
function onlyGetNavigations(url, details) {
  if (details.resourceType === "document" && details.method !== "GET") {
    return { allowed: false, reason: "no non-GET top-level navigations" };
  }
  return null;
}

new NetworkPolicy({ custom: onlyGetNavigations });
```

An `allowed: true` returned from the hook still cannot reach a metadata endpoint
— that floor is re-checked after the hook.

## Upstream egress proxies

With an [`upstreamProxy`](launch-identity.md#egress-proxy) configured, every
approved connection — loopback and private addresses included — is tunneled
through that proxy, so those addresses resolve on the proxy host's network.
Harden the policy (`allowLoopback: false`, `allowPrivateNetwork: false`) when
the proxy is remote and its network must stay out of reach.

## Decision caching

A page pulling 200 subresources would otherwise ask the client 200 times about
the same few hosts, so the worker keeps a short-lived cache of guard decisions,
keyed by scheme + host + port and held for at most 5 seconds. Allows and denies
are both cached; a failed check never is.

Only decisions from a stock `NetworkPolicy` with no `custom` hook are eligible —
the client decides, per policy, whether its answers may be cached at all:

- **A `custom` hook, a `NetworkPolicy` subclass, or any other object with a
  `check` method is never cached.** Every request reaches your hook, so a policy
  that decides on `details`, time, or external state keeps working exactly as
  written.
- **Installing a hook mid-session empties the cache**, so it governs hosts the
  browser has already contacted rather than only new ones. The first check that
  reaches the client after the change is what carries the flush, and navigations
  are never cached — so in practice the next page load does it. A request to an
  already-cached host with no such check in between falls back to the 5-second
  expiry below.
- **Mutating `allowHosts` or `blockHosts` mid-session takes up to 5 seconds to
  take effect** for a host the browser has already contacted. Hosts not yet seen
  (and every host after the entry expires) use the new lists immediately. Unlike
  installing a hook, editing these lists does not change the *shape* of the
  policy, so nothing in a decision marks it as changed and there is nothing for a
  flush to key off — the expiry is the whole mechanism.

If a change must apply immediately and you cannot wait for either, construct the
policy the way you want it before the browser launches, or close the session.

## Why metadata endpoints are unliftable

A server-side agent usually runs on a cloud instance whose metadata service
(`169.254.169.254` and friends) hands out the machine's credentials to anything
that can make an HTTP request from the box. A prompt-injected page trying to
read those is one of the sharpest risks in agent browsing. So the block is not
just a policy default — it is enforced at two independent layers:

1. **The transport guard.** Locally launched browsers and guarded Electron
   attachments force traffic through the worker's own loopback SOCKS proxy,
   including localhost. The proxy validates the connect target *and*
   re-validates every IP the hostname
   resolved to, so a hostname that passes cannot be swapped for a metadata
   address by DNS rebinding.
2. **The policy.** `NetworkPolicy` refuses metadata hosts and refuses to honor
   an `allowHosts` entry or a `custom` allow that names one.

For those guarded browsers, either layer stops the common case; together they
close the redirect and rebinding variants too. An ordinary remote CDP
attachment has no local transport guard, so it does not gain that guarantee.

## Failure is closed

If the policy check itself errors — an exception in a `custom` hook, a transport
fault while resolving — the request is denied, not allowed. A broken guard must
never silently become an open browser.
