# BetterWright documentation

**The token-efficient browser for AI agents** — one persistent, policy-guarded
browser engineered so every observation costs the fewest tokens possible.

BetterWright is used in two ways — **integrated**, where *your* agent drives
the browser (skill, MCP, Pi, or the [JS API](javascript.md)), and
**standalone**, where BetterWright's own agent loop drives
(`betterwright exec "<task>"`) and returns one JSON answer.
[getting-started.md](getting-started.md#pick-your-shape-first) explains how to
pick; most pages apply to both.

## Start here

New here: `bun install -g betterwright && betterwright init`. That one command
installs the browser, wires up the agent hosts on your machine, and proves the
whole path works by loading a real page.
