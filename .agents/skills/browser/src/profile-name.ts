// Named browser profiles inside one BetterWright home.
//
// A home has always held exactly one persistent browser profile at
// `browser/profile`, and that stays the default, byte-for-byte: an existing
// install keeps its logins with no migration and no move. A caller that needs
// two *separate identities* in one home — a work account and a personal one, a
// posting account and a reading account — passes a profile name. Each name is
// an independent persistent profile at `browser/profiles/<name>` with its own
// cookie jar, its own lock, and (see daemon.ts) its own session daemon.
//
// This is not the same axis as `--session`. Sessions are concurrent lanes
// inside ONE browser sharing ONE cookie jar; profiles are separate cookie jars
// in separate browsers. Parallel work as the same identity wants sessions;
// different identities want profiles.
//
// The name becomes a path segment, a lock-directory basename, and a socket
// filename, so it is validated hard against an allowlist rather than a
// blocklist: anything that could contain a separator, "..", or an absolute
// path would let a caller read or lock a directory outside `browser/profiles/`.
