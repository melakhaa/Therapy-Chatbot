// The worker's network guard entrypoint: turns a URL into a policy decision by
// asking the client over RPC, and caches the answers the client marks cacheable
// so a page pulling hundreds of subresources does not pay a round trip each.
//
// This module holds no policy of its own — decisions come from the client, which
// is the only process the policy and its custom hook live in.
//
// Security contract:
//   - Cacheability is asserted by the client and only by the client, which sets
//     `cacheable: true` solely for a stock NetworkPolicy with no custom hook —
//     the one shape whose verdict is a pure function of scheme, host, and port.
//     The worker never infers it: anything other than the literal `true`
//     (absent, false, a truthy non-boolean) means do not cache.
//   - Only host-scoped checks are cached. `fullUrl` checks (navigations,
//     documents, downloads, websockets) carry a path and details no host key can
//     represent, so they always reach the client.
//   - The key reads the port the same way NetworkPolicy does — straight off the
//     parsed URL (`src/policy.ts` check) — so two URLs share a key exactly when
//     the policy cannot tell them apart. WHATWG parsing already erases a
//     scheme's default port, which is why `https://h/` and `https://h:443/` are
//     one entry; a port written into the key by any other route would have to
//     re-derive that equivalence and could drift from it.
//   - Failures are never cached. An RPC rejection propagates unchanged and
//     leaves no entry, so the transport still fails closed on the next attempt.
//   - A response that is not cacheable empties the cache. Declining to write
//     new entries would still leave the old ones answering for hosts the
//     browser had already contacted, so a `custom` hook installed mid-session
//     would govern only new hosts — which is not what "never cached" means.
//     Any navigation is an uncacheable check, so a page load flushes.
//   - allowHosts/blockHosts are public mutable arrays, and a mutation is
//     invisible from here: the verdict shape is unchanged, so nothing in a
//     response marks it. Those converge on `ttlMs` instead. The same bound
//     covers the one case the flush above cannot see — an already-cached host
//     re-checked with no uncacheable check in between.
//   - The cache belongs to the guard it was created with. A worker process
//     serves one BetterWright and therefore one policy, so decisions made under
//     one policy can never answer for another.
