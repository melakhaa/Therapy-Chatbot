# BetterChromium 153 build

This directory is the reproducible definition for the browser source worktree. Chromium itself remains an external gclient checkout.

Pinned revisions:

- Chromium `153.0.8010.36`: `507c6ee3e2f3b2ca0e660547e5b9ea4820c67f4c`
- V8: `f343157cebb388bfa416baccb5d35507e6fe8cc7`

## Checkout and patch

Copy `gclient-153.py` to `<work>/.gclient`. Before syncing, apply the small
`depot-tools-custom-deps.patch` to depot_tools so it honors `custom_deps: None`
for CIPD packages as well as Git dependencies:

```sh
git -C /path/to/depot_tools apply /absolute/path/to/betterwright/scripts/chromium/depot-tools-custom-deps.patch
```

The config omits old Windows Chrome installers used only by upstream updater
integration tests. They are not inputs to the `chrome` and `inspector-test`
release targets. The depot_tools revision used for this build is
`36a8df4ad006eaa0572fb446edb8145fe5403592`.

Run `gclient sync --no-history` and `gclient runhooks`, then:

```sh
scripts/chromium/apply-patches.sh <work>/src
```

`apply-patches.sh` refuses the wrong revisions or dirty trees and checks both patches before changing either checkout.

## Build

With depot_tools on `PATH`:

```sh
scripts/chromium/build.sh mac <work>/src out/BetterChromiumStatic
scripts/chromium/build.sh linux <work>/src out/LinuxStatic
scripts/chromium/build.sh win <work>/src out/WinStatic
```

The Chromium patch also carries the BetterChromium product name and macOS bundle
identifier, so a clean build produces the bundle expected by the packager.

The V8 patch guards WebAssembly memory-map system calls by the operating system
executing the code. This lets macOS build the host snapshot tools for a Linux
target while retaining the Linux implementation in the shipped browser.

The default profile is a static release build with proprietary Chrome codecs. PGO remains disabled in the reproducible default because Chromium profile artifacts are platform/revision coupled. PGO/ThinLTO candidates must be benchmarked against this control before replacing it.

## Package

`build.sh` records GN's `chrome` runtime dependencies in
`<out>/betterchromium.runtime_deps`, adding Linux's wrapper, desktop icon, and
separately built sandbox helper (GN omits copy-target outputs). The Linux and Windows packager stages only
that list, validates essential browser files, and writes the zip with Python
3.11 or newer. It does not copy object files, build caches, or unrelated test
executables. For a manually invoked build, generate the list first:

```sh
(cd <work>/src && gn desc out/WinStatic //chrome:chrome runtime_deps > out/WinStatic/betterchromium.runtime_deps)
```

For Linux, also build `chrome_sandbox` and append `chrome-wrapper`,
`product_logo_48.png`, and `chrome_sandbox` to the runtime list, as `build.sh` does.

```sh
scripts/chromium/package.sh mac <work>/src/out/BetterChromiumStatic /tmp/betterchromium-mac-arm64.zip
scripts/chromium/package.sh linux <work>/src/out/LinuxStatic /tmp/betterchromium-linux-x64.zip
scripts/chromium/package.sh win <work>/src/out/WinStatic /tmp/betterchromium-win-x64.zip
```

The Windows launcher embeds Chromium's normal version-named private assembly
dependency for `chrome_elf.dll`. Packaging must include the matching
`win-x64/<version>.manifest`; `package.sh` supplies the pinned manifest to the
runtime packager, which fails if `chrome_elf.dll` is absent. Omitting that file makes Windows reject the
executable during activation-context generation before Chromium starts.

Apple system fonts are never included in public archives. `research/assemble-mac-fonts.sh` remains a private deployment overlay.
