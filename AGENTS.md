# AGENTS.md

**Sajiwa** — AI mental health support for university students and counselors. Students use an
Expo app (AI chat, stress detection, PHQ-9/GAD-7/SRQ + the versioned DASS-21 instrument,
journaling); counselors/admins use a Next.js dashboard (risk monitoring, analytics, booking,
instrument authoring). An npm-workspace monorepo holds the frontend apps, the FastAPI backend
(Python 3.12), and the shared TypeScript packages; Docker runs PostgreSQL 17 + pgvector, Ollama
provides the local LLM/embeddings.

## Structure

```
Therapy-Chatbot/
├── apps/
│   ├── mobile/        Expo React Native app (expo-router) — student-facing
│   ├── dashboard/     Next.js app — counselor/admin
│   └── backend/       FastAPI (Python 3.12) API + chatbot services
├── packages/          Shared TS: api-client, ui-shared, utils
├── db/                SQL baseline, migrations, RLS self-check
├── docs/              Setup + per-stack convention docs (linked below)
├── docker-compose.yml PostgreSQL 17 + pgvector + pgAdmin
└── package.json       Root workspace
```

Each app, package, and `db/` also has a local `AGENTS.md` — read it when working there.
