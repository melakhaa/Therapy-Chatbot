# Semantic Router conventions

Intent routing lives in `apps/backend/services/chatbot/`. Library: `semantic-router`
(`>=0.0.72`). The router is the decision layer — it picks a route; each route then has its
own handler.

## Pipeline

```
user message
   → semantic_router(message)          core.py  (the only entry point)
       ├─ is_crisis(message)?  ────────→ "guardrail"   <-- deterministic, runs FIRST
       └─ embedding match
           ├─ "guardrail"      → HARDCODED_RESPONSE             guardrail.py
           ├─ "conversational" → LLM reply                      conversational.py
           └─ "rag"            → retrieve_docs() → LLM answer   rag.py
```

`core.py` builds the single router and exposes `chat_stream(user_message, session_id=None,
user_id=None, route=None)`, with `chat(...)` as that generator joined. Callers that already routed
(`routes/chat.py` does, for the guardrail decision) pass `route=` so the message is not embedded
twice; `route=None` routes internally. The HTTP layer turns the generator into SSE — see
[fastapi-conventions.md](fastapi-conventions.md).

```python
semantic_router = SemanticRouter(
    routes=[guardrail_route, conversational_route, rag_route],
    encoder=OllamaEncoder(name="nomic-embed-text-v2-moe"),
    auto_sync="local",
)
```

Speech-to-intent calls are `semantic_router(message)` → `.name` is the matched route
(falls back to `"conversational"` when `None`).

## Crisis detection is NOT left to the router

`guardrail.is_crisis()` is a normalized keyword check that runs **before** the embedding
match. All four route decisions in `routes/chat.py` import `semantic_router` from
`core.py`, which is the wrapper function — so the keyword net cannot be bypassed.

The router alone is not a safety boundary. In testing it missed:

- "aku udah minum obat banyak"
- "aku pegang pisau sekarang"
- "aku mau loncat dari gedung"

and all three were handled as ordinary conversation by the LLM, with no hotline card and
nothing written to `guardrail_logs`. Embedding distance is not a safety property.

Rules when touching this:

- New crisis wording goes in **both** `CRISIS_PHRASES` in `guardrail.py` and the
  `guardrail_route` utterances. Write each phrase once in its canonical form —
  `_normalize()` folds leet/alay spelling (`bunuh d1r1` → `bunuh diri`), letter
  elongation (`matiii` → `mati`), and slang (`gw`→`aku`, `gak`→`tidak`, `idup`→`hidup`,
  `udah`→`sudah`, `pengen`→`ingin`) before matching, so `CRISIS_PHRASES` should not
  accumulate variant spellings. Slang not in `_SLANG` still needs its own phrase or
  map entry.
- Utterances help the fuzzy matcher with paraphrases — those still want colloquial
  wording.
- Bias toward matching. A false positive shows a student the hotline card — harmless.
  A false negative means a student in crisis is talking to an LLM.
- Keep the battery in `scripts/api_smoke.py` green; it asserts every crisis phrasing is
  flagged, that the reply is the fixed hotline text, and that ordinary distress still
  reaches the normal path.

## Defining a route

Each route is a `semantic_router.Route(name, utterances=[...])`. Utterances are **Indonesian**
and are the only thing that trains the match — adding a capability usually means adding
utterances, not new branching logic.

- **guardrail** (`guardrail.py`) — self-harm / harm-to-others phrases. Handler returns the
  fixed `HARDCODED_RESPONSE` with hotlines. Never route this to an LLM.
- **conversational** (`conversational.py`) — greetings and emotional support. Persona "Hana",
  warm Bahasa Indonesia `SYSTEM_PROMPT`.
- **rag** (`rag.py`) — factual mental-health questions; see
  [ollama-conventions.md](ollama-conventions.md) for retrieval + generation.

## Conventions

- Keep one file per route; export the `Route` object and its handler.
- `semantic_router` is a module-level singleton in `core.py` — don't rebuild per request.
- `auto_sync="local"`; the router embeds every route utterance when it is constructed, so a dead
  Ollama raises at **import** and the backend refuses to start (no zero-vector fallback — that would
  mis-route silently). See [ollama-conventions.md](ollama-conventions.md).
- Expose results over HTTP as `{ route, is_high_risk, response }` (`routes/chat.py`).
- Every chatbot file has an `if __name__ == "__main__":` block of sample utterances to
  smoke-test routing. Use it when tuning utterances.
