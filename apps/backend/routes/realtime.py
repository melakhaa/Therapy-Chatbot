"""Live change notices for the dashboard: WebSocket /realtime.

A notice names only the area that changed ("signals", "requests", "schedule"), never a row, a
name or a score. The dashboard answers it by refetching through the REST routes, so their role
checks and caseload scoping stay the only gate on student data, and a delivery mistake here can
leak "something changed" at most.
