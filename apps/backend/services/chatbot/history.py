"""Prompt history assembly, kept free of the semantic router so it stays cheap to import.

`core.py` builds a SemanticRouter at import time (and embeds every utterance), so anything
importing it needs a live Ollama and an ENCRYPTION_KEY. This module needs neither, which is
what lets `tests/test_chat_history.py` check the crisis filter without a model.
